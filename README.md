# AI Chatbot Project 🤖

This is an AI chatbot project that I built using **HTML, CSS, API key, and JavaScript**.

## 🌐 Live Demo
🔗 https://ripudaman04.github.io/gemini-chatbot-clone/

## Chatbot UI Features
The ChatGPT-style UI includes:
- Chat-style conversation layout
- Typing animation for AI responses
- Markdown support (headings, lists, code blocks)
- Syntax highlighting for code
- Copy button for code blocks
- Light / Dark theme toggle
- File upload (image / PDF preview)
- **Delete chat option** to clear all conversations

## About AI (Important)
During development, this project was **fully connected to the Google Gemini API** and was working properly with real AI responses.

Later, I removed the API key from the frontend **for security and billing safety reasons**, because:
- API keys should not be public
- Public repositories can leak keys
- API misuse can cause unexpected billing

## Backend Note (Beginner Context)
I have **not used a backend in this project**.

I am currently a **beginner** and still learning backend development.  
At this stage, I am confident with **JavaScript and frontend development**, and I am actively working on improving my backend skills.

Because of this, the API was initially used directly in the frontend and later removed for safety.

## Proof of Working AI
Before removing the API key, I recorded a **screen video** showing:
- AI responses working correctly
- File upload feature
- Markdown rendering
- Copy button functionality
- Delete chat option
- Complete chatbot interaction flow

The video proof is shared separately (LinkedIn / Drive).

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Google Gemini API (used during development)

## Note for Recruiters
This project demonstrates:
- Strong frontend fundamentals
- Real API integration experience
- UI/UX attention to detail
- Security awareness and responsible handling of API keys

I am continuously learning and can re-integrate the AI using a secure backend approach in future versions.
